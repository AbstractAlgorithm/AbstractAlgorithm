    <p>Hello, my name is Dragan Okanovic. I am from Belgrade, Serbia. I study School of Electrical Engineering.</p>

    <p>I am passionate about natural computing. That includes (but is not limited to) computer graphics, evolutionary programming and artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>I spent quite some time learning about computer graphics. It's probably the most beautiful (visually) and the most interesting field of programming. Mimicing light phenomena, trying to fake the effects for better performance, it's just fun.</p>

    <p>Recently, I started learning about genetic algorithms and neural networks. That area of programming have the ability to, literally, change the world as we know it. Amazing possibilities might open up.</p>

    <p>I am also a web developer. I very much enjoy coding in JavaScript, but I don't lack back-end knowledge either. Actually, this site runs on the <a href="">framework I've written</a>.</p>

    <p>When I am not coding, I like to spend time listening to the <a href="">music</a>, riding a bicycle, <a href="">juggling</a>, practicing card tricks or solving Rubik's cube blindfolded.</p>

    <p>I <a href="">draw</a> sometimes.</p>
