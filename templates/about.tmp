    <h3>Who am I</h3>

    <p>Hello, I am Dragan Okanovic. I am from Belgrade, Serbia. I study School of Electrical Engineering.</p>

    <h3>What I do</h3>

    <p>I am a programmer passionate about natural computing. That includes (but is not limited to) computer graphics, evolutionary programming and artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>I spent quite some time learning about computer graphics. It's probably the most beautiful (visually) and the most interesting field of programming. Mimicing light phenomena and trying to fake the effects for better performance requires one special combination of creativity and previous knowledge that is both very fun and challenging.</p>

    <p>Recently, I started taking interest into genetic algorithms and neural networks. Those branches of programming have the ability to, literally, change the world as we know it. Thought about creating intelligence greater than our own sounds like sci-fi, but it catches your imagination allowing you to dream big. But it also leaves you scared to the bone, thinking about what might happen if things perhaps took a wrong turn.</p>

    <p>I am also a web developer. I very much enjoy coding in JavaScript, but I don't lack back-end knowledge either. Actually, this site runs on the <a href="">framework I've written</a>.</p>

    <h3>Hedonism</h3>

    <p>When I am not coding, I like to spend time listening to the <a href="">music</a>, riding a bicycle, <a href="">juggling</a>, practicing card tricks or solving Rubik's cube blindfolded.</p>

    <p>I <a href="">draw</a> sometimes.</p>

    <p>If you are a company or an employer - I am interested in internship and job offers.</p>

    <h3>Why mushroom</h3>
    <p>I just like it. It kind of reminds me of the good ol' days when I was a kid. Things were different then.</p>

    <h3>What's on the logo</h3>
    <p>Very stylized version of an 'A' letter. 'A' as in 'Abstract Algorithm'. Read <a href="#">this</a>.</p>

    <h3>Abstract what...?</h3>
    <p>Read <a href="#">this</a>.</p>

    <h3>The glass is...</h3>
    <p>...half-full.</p>
