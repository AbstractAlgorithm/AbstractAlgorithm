    <p>Hello, my name is Dragan Okanovic. I am a student, real-time graphics programmer and front-end developer from Belgrade, Serbia. And this is my blog.</p>

    <p>I find real-time graphics extremely exciting and challenging, yet amazing bacuse of the light phenomena that occur in the nature. Light is beautiful and programming its effects is creative.</p>

    <p>I also enjoy working on <a href="#">genetic algorithms</a>, neural networks and other nature-based stuff. If you wondereded what's an 'Abstract Algorithm', read <a href="#">this</a>.</p>

    <p>I like to play with: JavaScript, GLSL, python</p>
